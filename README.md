# Fixing the communication issues of a pizzeria using ICT

## Project background

Mario is the owner of a small family pizza shop known for its good quality delicious pizza. Recently, Mario's business has been gaining popularity and some changes must be made to accommodate for the new flow of customers. Currently, the pizza shop has two employees, Mario and his brother Luigi. At this time, the shop cannot afford to expand its staff. Mario counts to improve his business by integrating smart ICT systems.

### Current Workflow
- The cashier receives an order from the customer.
- The same employee shouts the order to the kitchen.
- The cook attempts to comprehend the shouting and writes it downon a note.
- The cook places the prepared pizza on a production linewhich goes through an oven.
- The pizza reaches the end of theproductionlineand is ready to be served.
- The cook periodically looks at the end of the production lineand shouts to the cashier if a pizza is ready.
- The cashier picks up the pizza, if he hears the cook, and brings it to the customer.

## Problem definition
As the shop increased the number of customers, more and more complaints got in about receiving the wrong pizza, a cold pizza or not getting anything at all. Using ICT skills, some of the processes can be automated. The shop can be modernized by improving the work conditions of the employees and enabling the owner to make delicious pizzas for his new clientele.

## Project goal
The project goal is to help Mario and his brother to create a more efficient operation. For a successful ICT solution, knowledge from five different courses will be applied.
